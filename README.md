```
Category and Transaction are classes for storage information, no methods.
```
```
Wallet class is private inner class of User.
```
```
It allows to control all wallets through user, who own them or have access to them. 
According to that descision, all actions with wallets need user with rights on those wallets 
and there is no way to make inaccessible operation.
```
```
It grants us more security and we have clearly logical interaction, 
where user can do something with his wallets as it is in real life.
```
```
Howewer we have no ability to interact directly with wallets, 
that can be inconvenient in some cases
```
